# Credit-Risk-Analysis-Through-EDA-
In this project, we have used exploratory data analysis (EDA) for credit risk analysis. Our objective is to help banks identify patterns behind loan defaults so that they can make better lending decisions. This not only helps banks avoid losses but also benefits borrowers.

Loan-providing companies face challenges when customers have insufficient or non-existent credit histories, leading to potential defaults. By leveraging EDA, we aim to:
- Reduce the risk of loan defaults.
- Ensure that repaying applicants are not rejected.
- Make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, rejections, or adjustments.

- The primary objective is to identify patterns indicating the likelihood of a client defaulting on their loan repayments. By doing so, the company can take preemptive 
  action such as:
- Denying loans to high-risk applicants.
- Lending at higher interest rates.
- Reducing loan amounts.

### **Data Understanding** ðŸŽ²
We have three key datasets:
- **Application Data (application_data.csv)**: Information about clients at the time of application.
- **Previous Application (previous_application.csv)**: Data on clients' previous loan applications.
- **Columns Description (columns_description.csv)**: Data dictionary describing variables.
