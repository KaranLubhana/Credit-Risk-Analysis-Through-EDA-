# Credit-Risk-Analysis-Through-EDA-
In this project, we have used exploratory data analysis (EDA) for credit risk analysis. Our objective is to help banks identify patterns behind loan defaults so that they can make better lending decisions. This not only helps banks avoid losses but also benefits borrowers.
